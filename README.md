# D2 Map Seed Tool

## Warning: Back up your files! Better safe than sorry.

This tool reads the map seed from a d2s file or inserts a map seed into a d2s file (as well as a valid new checksum).

## Usage



### Notes

* Only tested with D2R.

* Requires Python 3, no dependencies

* You can run the program and get a map seed while the game is running, but inserting a new seed will only work if the game is not running.

* Thanks to [krisives](https://github.com/krisives/d2s-format), [nokka](https://github.com/nokka/d2s) and others for information on the d2s header and checksum algorithm
